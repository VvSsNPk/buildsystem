// The scheduler owns a dependency graph of tasks and drives it forward by
// handing "ready" tasks to the executor and reacting to the state updates
// the executor reports back. Crucially: nodes and edges are never removed
// from the graph. Completion is tracked purely as per-node state
// (`ExecutorState`), which is what "ready" is computed from. This mirrors
// what actually happens on the wire: sending a task on `sender` only means
// "the executor accepted it", not "it ran" - the executor reports Running,
// then Finished/Failed, asynchronously and out of order, via
// `state_updater`. Mutating graph structure on send (the old approach)
// conflated those two things and could unblock a task's dependents before
// the dependency had actually finished.
